# Python Syntax

1.  Execute Python Syntax

    As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

    ```py
    >>> print("Hello, World!")
    Hello, World!
    ```

    Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:

    ```py
    C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
    ```

2.  Python Indentation

    Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line

    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important

    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code

    ```py
    if 5 > 2
        print('Five is greater than two')

    ```

    The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

    ```py
        if 5 > 2:
            print("Five is greater than two!")
        if 5 > 2:
                    print("Five is greater than two!")
    ```

3.  Python variables

    In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

    ```py
    x = 5
    y = "Hello, World!"
    ```
